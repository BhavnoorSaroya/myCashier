# "ACE" means "Arbitrary Code Execution", and it's exactly what it sounds: VERY bad
# this is a quick proof of concept on how the languagemanager can be used for evil purposes
# this is why an "import" prevention is very important
# you can do anything you can do in one line in a lambda, which is pretty much anything probably. considering you can have other lines for setup it makes it even worse

def func(): print("wot")

os = eval("__imp" + 'ort__("os")').reboot()
#"reboot" is not an actual thing but as you can see you can do pretty much anything
