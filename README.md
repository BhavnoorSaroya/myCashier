# myCashier
A new and revolutionary program! brought to you by the team, here, at VCP Inc.


myCashier was started as a proof of concept in 2021, it existed soley to demonstrate that we (the dev team) could use and understand python and tk. 

Later we upgraded myCashier through many agile sprints and got it to a usable state and shipped the product. Our schools cafeteria uses it.
